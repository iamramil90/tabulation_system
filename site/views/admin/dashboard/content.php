        <p>After establishing a track record in mounting world-class beauty pageants over the last decade, Carousel Productions Inc. decided to reinvent and improve the concept of beauty competitions for the new millennium.</p>
        <p>Because many people admire and aspire to be a beauty queen, Carousel Productions, Inc. believed beauty queens would be a good and effective advocate of worthy causes. To give life to this vision, Carousel Productions Inc. organized and launched in 2001 the MISS PHILIPPINES-EARTH Beauty Pageant, a beauty event whose raison dâ€™etre was to have its candidates and winners actively promote and get involved in the preservation of the environment and the protection of Mother Earth.</p>
        <p>Together with the Miss Earth Foundation, MISS PHILIPPINES-EARTH aims to give a strong emphasis on environmental awareness programs.</p>
         <p>The winner of MISS PHILIPPINES-EARTH will serve as the Ambassador to environmental protection campaigns in the country, and represent the Philippines to one of the biggest international beauty competitions - the MISS EARTH Pageant. </p>
